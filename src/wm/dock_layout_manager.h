// Decides, for every dock and panel the shell maps, whether it is on
// screen right now, and slides it off its screen edge when it is not. The dock
// itself only draws: it never unmaps, and it learns nothing about the pointer.
// A panel such as the status bar follows the same rules, minus the setting: it
// only gives way to a fullscreen window.
//
// Two decisions, as upstream: the visibility state comes from the setting and
// from the windows on the dock's output; the auto-hide state, only meaningful
// under AutoHide, from what would be interrupted by hiding - the pointer on the
// dock or at its edge, a menu of the dock's, the launcher - and from whether
// there is a window to make room for at all. Showing, and hiding because the
// pointer left, wait kAutoHideDelayMs; anything else hides at once.
// A panel along the top edge comes back to the pointer over a fullscreen
// window only once the window has declared its bars; it then tells the
// window when it comes and goes, keeps itself shown while the pointer is over
// those bars, and pushes the window down with it when the window asks for
// that.
// A dock or panel that maps slides in from its edge, as the session starts.
// The window overview pushes the panels off their edge as it comes in,
// following its progress, and lets them back as it leaves.
//
// Must be destroyed before the WindowManager it observes.
